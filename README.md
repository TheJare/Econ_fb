# Economy game
Example of a Facebook game built with HTML client + NodeJS server + MongoDB persistance

Still very early Work In Progress.

You can try it locally even without a mongodb, just by running 'node app.js' to start the server then going to
http://apps.facebook.com/239838146090075/ on Facebook without secure browsing. That app's canvas is configured 
to load from http://localhost:3000/
